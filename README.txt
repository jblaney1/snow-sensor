This repo is intended to contain all of the code for the snow sensor senior
design project. The 'testing' directory primarily contains software to test
sensor connections and functionality. It also contains some initial setup
automation. The file 'testing/deploy_testing_suite.sh' is intended to contain
all the software and is to be run on a pi zero with an internet connection. It
will prepare the pi for initial testing of the sensors and their wiring.

Please note that this repo contains some software that is free licensed open
source. Each piece of FLOSS has its own licensing file, so see those for more
details.
